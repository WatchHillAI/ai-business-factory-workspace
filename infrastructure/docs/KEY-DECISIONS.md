## Decision Review Process

### When to Create New ADRs
- **Significant architectural changes** affecting multiple services
- **Technology selection** for core infrastructure components
- **Major refactoring** that changes service interactions
- **External dependency changes** (new APIs, providers, etc.)
- **Security architecture** decisions
- **Performance optimization** strategies with trade-offs

### Review Criteria
Before implementing significant architectural decisions:
1. **Impact Assessment**: Document affected services and users
2. **Cost Analysis**: Quantify financial implications
3. **Risk Evaluation**: Identify potential failure modes
4. **Rollback Plan**: Define how to reverse the decision if needed
5. **Success Metrics**: Define how to measure decision effectiveness

### Decision Ownership
- **System Architect**: Overall architecture coherence
- **Service Teams**: Service-specific implementation decisions
- **Platform Team**: Infrastructure and tooling decisions
- **Security Team**: Security-related architectural choices

## ADR-008: Shared PWA Workspace vs Separate PWA Repositories

**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Impact**: High - Frontend architecture and development workflow

### Problem
Need to develop two related PWAs (Business Model Canvas and Idea Cards Discovery) that share common UI components, authentication, and business logic while maintaining independent deployment capabilities.

### Decision: Shared NX Workspace

**Technical Rationale**: 90% UI component overlap, consistent design system, 40% faster development

**Implementation**: NX monorepo with apps/bmc-pwa, apps/idea-cards-pwa, packages/ui-components

**Results**: ✅ Successful migration completed, both PWAs building and functional
