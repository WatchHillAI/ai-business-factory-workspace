## Repository Consolidation Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-23  
**Phase**: Hybrid Modular Monorepo Migration (Phase 2.2)  

### Original Repository Structure (11 → 1)

All functionality has been consolidated from these external repositories into domain-based packages:

#### ✅ **Consolidated Repositories:**

1. **`ai-business-factory-infrastructure`** → `infrastructure/`
   - Complete Terraform modules and environment configurations
   - AWS deployment automation and CI/CD workflows

2. **`ai-business-factory-business-generator`** → `domains/idea-generation/packages/business-generator/`
   - AI-powered business plan generation service
   - Multi-model AI routing with cost optimization

3. **`ai-business-factory-data-collector`** → `domains/market-intelligence/packages/data-collector/`
   - Web scraping and data collection from free sources
   - Market signal detection and data validation

4. **`ai-business-factory-market-validator`** → `domains/market-intelligence/packages/market-validator/`
   - Market validation logic and feasibility scoring
   - Risk assessment and market opportunity analysis

5. **`ai-business-factory-opportunity-analyzer`** → `domains/market-intelligence/packages/opportunity-analyzer/`
   - Business opportunity scoring and analysis
   - Multi-criteria evaluation and competitive assessment

6. **`ai-business-factory-scheduler`** → `domains/ai-orchestration/packages/scheduler/`

   - Resource allocation and timing optimization

7. **`ai-business-factory-strategy-manager`** → `domains/idea-generation/packages/strategy-manager/`
   - Business strategy optimization and management
   - Go-to-market strategy and competitive positioning

8. **`ai-business-factory-shared-utilities`** → `domains/shared/packages/shared-utilities/`

   - Cross-domain shared functionality

9. **`ai-business-factory`** (original hub) → `docs/legacy/original-hub/`
   - Original project documentation and prototypes
   - UX research, personas, and design systems

### Domain Organization

The consolidated repository follows a domain-driven design approach:

```
ai-business-factory-workspace/
├── domains/
│   ├── market-intelligence/     # Market research & data collection
│   ├── idea-generation/         # Business idea lifecycle & UI
│   ├── ai-orchestration/        # AI system coordination
│   └── shared/                  # Cross-domain utilities
├── infrastructure/              # Terraform & AWS deployment
└── docs/                       # Documentation & ADRs
```

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Repository Management**: Unified development workflow
2. **Domain-Driven Architecture**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities  
3. **Claude Code Optimization**: Context-sized development tasks
4. **Simplified CI/CD**: Single deployment pipeline
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: No cross-repo synchronization needed

### Legacy Access

All original repositories remain available but are considered archived:
- Original documentation preserved in this directory
- Git history maintained for valuable contributions
- No ongoing development on external repositories
