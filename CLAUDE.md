# Claude AI Assistant Notes

## Project Overview
AI Business Factory PWA Workspace - A revolutionary shared monorepo for AI-powered Progressive Web Applications featuring advanced business intelligence. The Ideas PWA transforms simple business concepts into comprehensive, actionable insights using sophisticated AI agents.

### ü§ñ **AI Agent System Architecture (v1.0 - PRODUCTION READY)**
**Status**: Market Research Agent deployed and tested with 87% confidence
**Infrastructure**: Complete framework with orchestration, caching, quality assurance
**Next Phase**: Financial Modeling, Founder Fit, and Risk Assessment agents

## Development Server Management

### üöÄ Starting Development Servers

#### Quick Start (Both Apps):
```bash
# Start both BMC and Ideas PWAs simultaneously
npm run dev

# Access URLs:
# - BMC PWA: http://localhost:3001/
# - Ideas PWA: http://localhost:3002/
```

#### Individual App Startup:
```bash
# BMC PWA only (port 3001)
npm run dev:bmc

# Ideas PWA only (port 3002)
npm run dev:ideas
```

#### Manual Startup (if npm scripts fail):
```bash
# Navigate to workspace root
cd /Users/cnorton/Development/ai-business-factory-workspace

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Start Ideas PWA directly with Vite
cd apps/idea-cards-pwa
npx vite --port 3002 --host 0.0.0.0 &

# Start BMC PWA directly with Vite
cd ../bmc-pwa
npx vite --port 3001 --host 0.0.0.0 &
```

### üõë Stopping Development Servers

#### Complete Cleanup (Recommended):
```bash
# Kill all development processes
pkill -f "nx serve" || true
pkill -f "vite" || true
pkill -f "ai-business-factory" || true

# Verify cleanup
lsof -i :3001 || echo "Port 3001 is free"
lsof -i :3002 || echo "Port 3002 is free"
```

#### Process-Specific Cleanup:
```bash
# Find and kill specific processes
ps aux | grep -E "(vite|nx)" | grep -v grep
kill [PID_FROM_ABOVE]

# Or kill by port
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
```

### üîÑ Restart Sequence (Clean Restart):
```bash
# 1. Stop all processes
pkill -f "vite" || true; pkill -f "nx serve" || true

# 2. Wait for cleanup
sleep 2

# 3. Verify ports are free
lsof -i :3001 :3002 || echo "Ports are free"

# 4. Start fresh
npm run dev

# 5. Verify servers are running
sleep 3
curl -I http://localhost:3001/ && echo "BMC PWA: OK"
curl -I http://localhost:3002/ && echo "Ideas PWA: OK"
```

### üîß Troubleshooting Server Issues

#### Connection Problems:
```bash
# 1. Verify server is listening
lsof -nP -iTCP:3002 -sTCP:LISTEN
# Should show: node [PID] cnorton ... *:3002 (LISTEN)

# 2. Test HTTP connection
curl -v http://localhost:3002/ | head -10
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK + HTML content

# 3. Check network binding
netstat -an | grep 3002
# Should show: tcp46 ... *.3002 ... LISTEN

# 4. Alternative access methods
open http://localhost:3002/          # Default browser
open http://127.0.0.1:3002/          # IPv4 explicit
open http://[::1]:3002/              # IPv6 explicit  
open http://10.0.218.239:3002/       # Network IP
```

#### Build Issues:
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Build both apps to verify code integrity
npm run build

# Preview production builds
npm run preview:ideas  # Port 4173
npm run preview:bmc    # Port 4174
```

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Launch Script
For comprehensive system startup including infrastructure checks:
```bash
# Use the launch script from infrastructure repo
/Users/cnorton/Development/ai-business-factory-infrastructure/launch-local.sh

# This script provides:
# - Prerequisites checking
# - Infrastructure status verification
# - Automated server startup with health checks
# - Process management and cleanup
# - Comprehensive status reporting
```
