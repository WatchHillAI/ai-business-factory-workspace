# Claude AI Assistant Notes

## Project Overview
AI Business Factory PWA Workspace - A revolutionary shared monorepo for AI-powered Progressive Web Applications featuring advanced business intelligence. The Ideas PWA transforms simple business concepts into comprehensive, actionable insights using sophisticated AI agents.

### ü§ñ **AI Agent System Architecture (v1.0 - PRODUCTION READY)**
**Status**: Market Research Agent deployed and tested with 87% confidence
**Infrastructure**: Complete framework with orchestration, caching, quality assurance
**Next Phase**: Financial Modeling, Founder Fit, and Risk Assessment agents

## Development Server Management

### üöÄ Starting Development Servers

#### Quick Start (Both Apps):
```bash
# Start both BMC and Ideas PWAs simultaneously
npm run dev

# Access URLs:
# - BMC PWA: http://localhost:3001/
# - Ideas PWA: http://localhost:3002/
```

#### Individual App Startup:
```bash
# BMC PWA only (port 3001)
npm run dev:bmc

# Ideas PWA only (port 3002)
npm run dev:ideas
```

#### Manual Startup (if npm scripts fail):
```bash
# Navigate to workspace root
cd /Users/cnorton/Development/ai-business-factory-workspace

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Start Ideas PWA directly with Vite
cd apps/idea-cards-pwa
npx vite --port 3002 --host 0.0.0.0 &

# Start BMC PWA directly with Vite
cd ../bmc-pwa
npx vite --port 3001 --host 0.0.0.0 &
```

### üõë Stopping Development Servers

#### Complete Cleanup (Recommended):
```bash
# Kill all development processes
pkill -f "nx serve" || true
pkill -f "vite" || true
pkill -f "ai-business-factory" || true

# Verify cleanup
lsof -i :3001 || echo "Port 3001 is free"
lsof -i :3002 || echo "Port 3002 is free"
```

#### Process-Specific Cleanup:
```bash
# Find and kill specific processes
ps aux | grep -E "(vite|nx)" | grep -v grep
kill [PID_FROM_ABOVE]

# Or kill by port
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
```

### üîÑ Restart Sequence (Clean Restart):
```bash
# 1. Stop all processes
pkill -f "vite" || true; pkill -f "nx serve" || true

# 2. Wait for cleanup
sleep 2

# 3. Verify ports are free
lsof -i :3001 :3002 2>/dev/null || echo "Ports are free"

# 4. Start fresh (VERIFIED WORKING SEQUENCE)
npm run dev 2>&1 &

# 5. Verify servers are running
sleep 5
curl -I http://localhost:3001/ && echo "BMC PWA: OK"
curl -I http://localhost:3002/ && echo "Ideas PWA: OK"
```

### üéØ **VERIFIED WORKING DEV SERVER SEQUENCE**:
This command sequence has been tested and confirmed to reliably start both PWAs:
```bash
pkill -f "vite" || true; pkill -f "nx serve" || true
sleep 2 && lsof -i :3001 :3002 2>/dev/null || echo "Ports are free" 
npm run dev 2>&1 &
```
- ‚úÖ Kills any existing processes completely
- ‚úÖ Waits for proper cleanup 
- ‚úÖ Verifies ports are available (with proper error handling)
- ‚úÖ Starts both servers in background with output capture

### üîß Troubleshooting Server Issues

#### Connection Problems:
```bash
# 1. Verify server is listening
lsof -nP -iTCP:3002 -sTCP:LISTEN
# Should show: node [PID] cnorton ... *:3002 (LISTEN)

# 2. Test HTTP connection
curl -v http://localhost:3002/ | head -10
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK + HTML content

# 3. Check network binding
netstat -an | grep 3002
# Should show: tcp46 ... *.3002 ... LISTEN

# 4. Alternative access methods
open http://localhost:3002/          # Default browser
open http://127.0.0.1:3002/          # IPv4 explicit
open http://[::1]:3002/              # IPv6 explicit  
open http://10.0.218.239:3002/       # Network IP
```

#### Build Issues:
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Build both apps to verify code integrity
npm run build

# Preview production builds
npm run preview:ideas  # Port 4173
npm run preview:bmc    # Port 4174
```

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Launch Script
For comprehensive system startup including infrastructure checks:
```bash
# Use the launch script from infrastructure repo
/Users/cnorton/Development/ai-business-factory-infrastructure/launch-local.sh

# This script provides:
# - Prerequisites checking
# - Infrastructure status verification
# - Automated server startup with health checks
# - Process management and cleanup
# - Comprehensive status reporting
```

## Production Deployment

### Build Process:
```bash
# Build all applications
npm run build

# Outputs:
# - dist/apps/bmc-pwa/        (BMC PWA production files)
# - dist/apps/idea-cards-pwa/ (Ideas PWA production files)
# - dist/packages/            (Shared components)
```

### Production URLs:
- **BMC PWA**: https://d1u91xxklexz0v.cloudfront.net
- **Ideas PWA**: https://dc275i5wdcepx.cloudfront.net

### Deployment Pipeline:
GitHub Actions automatically handles:
1. Building both PWA applications
2. Uploading to S3 with path-based separation
3. Invalidating CloudFront caches
4. Running health checks

## üö® CRITICAL: Deployment Safety Checklist

**BEFORE ANY PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**, Claude MUST:
1. Ask: "Are we using the CI/CD pipeline or deploying manually?"
2. Verify: Current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)
3. Check: Tests passing (`npm test`)
4. Confirm: Target environment (staging vs production)
5. Verify: AWS configurations match (`aws cloudfront get-distribution-config`)

**RED FLAGS that require explicit user override:**
- Direct S3 uploads without PR
- Infrastructure changes without verification
- Skipping test suite
- Manual CloudFront invalidations
- Deploying from non-main branches

**REMEMBER**: The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline knows the correct bucket mappings and will prevent deployment errors.

## üö® IMPORTANT: Token Usage Economy

**ALWAYS be frugal with token consumption!** The project's success depends on efficient resource usage:
- Keep responses concise and focused
- Avoid unnecessary file generation or verbose explanations
- Use simple, direct solutions over complex ones
- Summarize rather than elaborate when possible

## üìã Product Backlog

Future enhancements and features are tracked in the **Product Backlog** at:
`~/Documents/ai-business-factory/BACKLOG.md`

The backlog contains items we want to work on but haven't committed to the current todo list. Reference this document as "the backlog", "the Backlog", or "the BACKLOG" (case insensitive).

## üìã Development Principles & Processes

### Core Principles

#### 1. Progress Through Process
*Fast is slow when fixing takes longer than doing it right.*
- Shortcuts compound into technical debt
- Process enables sustainable velocity  
- Automation prevents human error

#### 2. Trust but Verify
*Every deployment deserves validation.*
- Assume nothing about current state
- Verify configuration before changes
- Test in isolation before integration

#### 3. Fail Fast, Fix Forward
*Catch issues early when they're cheap to fix.*
- Local tests before commits
- CI/CD gates before deployment
- Monitoring after release

### Development Process Checklist

#### üöÄ For Rapid Prototyping (Local Development Only)
```bash
# Clean start sequence (VERIFIED WORKING)
‚úì pkill -f "vite" || true; pkill -f "nx serve" || true  # Kill existing
‚úì sleep 2 && lsof -i :3001 :3002 2>/dev/null || echo "Ports are free"
‚úì npm run dev 2>&1 &                                    # Start both PWAs
‚úì sleep 5                                               # Wait for startup
‚úì curl -I http://localhost:3001/ && echo "BMC PWA: OK"
‚úì curl -I http://localhost:3002/ && echo "Ideas PWA: OK"

‚úì Verify in staging first              # When available
‚úì Monitor after deployment             # Check metrics
```

#### üîß For Infrastructure Changes
```bash
‚úì Document current state      # aws [service] describe
‚úì Plan changes in writing     # What, why, impact
‚úì Test in dev environment    # If available
‚úì Create rollback plan       # How to undo
‚úì Apply during low traffic   # Minimize impact
‚úì Verify expected behavior   # Test thoroughly
```

### Pre-Deployment Verification Commands
```bash
# Before deploying to AWS
aws s3 ls | grep [bucket-name]                    # Verify bucket exists
aws cloudfront list-distributions --query '...'   # Check CF config
aws lambda list-functions                         # Verify functions

# After deployment
curl -I https://[domain]                         # Check response
aws logs tail [log-group] --follow              # Monitor errors
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **"It worked locally"** - Production is different
2. **"Just this once"** - Exceptions become habits  
3. **"I'll document it later"** - Later never comes
4. **"The tests are probably fine"** - They're not
5. **"It's a small change"** - Small changes can have big impacts

### Recovery Protocol
When things go wrong (and they will):
1. **Stop and assess** - Don't make it worse
2. **Document what happened** - For the post-mortem
3. **Fix the immediate issue** - Get systems running
4. **Create follow-up tasks** - Address root cause
5. **Update processes** - Prevent recurrence
