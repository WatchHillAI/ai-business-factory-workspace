# Session Handoff - July 28, 2025

## Current Status
Working on deploying the PostgreSQL JSONB schema via GitHub Actions. The Aurora cluster is successfully deployed manually (ADR-004), but persistent Terraform state drift issues are blocking automated schema deployment.

## Key Progress Today
1. **Fixed IAM permissions** - Added missing EC2 and CloudWatch Logs permissions
2. **Deployed Aurora cluster manually** - Documented in ADR-004 due to state drift
3. **Multiple workflow improvements attempted**:
   - Added resource import logic
   - Improved error handling
   - Added direct AWS CLI Aurora cluster detection
   - Created SKIP_INFRASTRUCTURE flag approach
4. **Created simplified schema-only workflow** - `deploy-database-schema-only.yml` that bypasses Terraform entirely

## Current Blockers
1. **Terraform State Drift**: GitHub Actions Terraform state doesn't know about existing AWS resources
2. **Resource Already Exists Errors**: Secrets Manager, DB subnet group, security group, CloudWatch logs all exist in AWS but not in GitHub Actions state
3. **Workflow Failures**: All attempts to handle state drift in the main workflow have failed

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/deploy-database.yml` - Multiple improvements to handle state drift
- `.github/workflows/deploy-database-schema-only.yml` - NEW simplified workflow
- `docs/ADR-004-Terraform-State-Drift-Resolution.md` - Documented state drift issue
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added Terraform state management protocols

## Next Steps
1. **Test simplified schema-only workflow** once it's available in GitHub Actions
2. **If that fails**, consider importing Terraform state manually in GitHub Actions
3. **Once schema deployed**, proceed with CRUD API implementation

## Key Commands for Reference
```bash
# Trigger simplified workflow
gh workflow run "Deploy Database Schema Only" --ref feature/live-ai-integration

# Check Aurora cluster directly
aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier ai-business-factory-db-dev

# Manual schema deployment (if needed)
cd infrastructure/database
./deploy-schema.sh
```

## Technical Context
- Aurora cluster endpoint: `ai-business-factory-db-dev.cluster-celmknfum3et.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- Database name: `ai_business_factory`
- Secret ARN: `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:519284856023:secret:ai-business-factory-db-dev-credentials-iFQoGn`
- The simplified workflow avoids Terraform completely and works directly with AWS APIs

## Todo List Status
- [x] Fix AWS IAM permissions for GitHub Actions database deployment
- [x] Complete Aurora PostgreSQL cluster deployment manually (ADR-004)
- [ ] Deploy Database Schema: PostgreSQL JSONB schema via GitHub Actions (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Debug GitHub Actions workflow - resolve Terraform state drift blocking schema deployment (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Test simplified schema-only deployment workflow (deploy-database-schema-only.yml)
- [ ] Implement CRUD APIs: Lambda functions for business ideas persistence
- [ ] Update AI Orchestrator: Save analysis results to database after generation
- [ ] Connect Ideas PWA: Load from database instead of generating on-demand
- [ ] Add Data Management: Search, filtering, idea history features

## Summary
The main challenge today was Terraform state drift between local and GitHub Actions environments. Despite multiple sophisticated attempts to handle this in the workflow, the state inconsistency persisted. Created a simplified workflow that bypasses Terraform entirely and works directly with AWS APIs to deploy the schema. This should resolve the blocking issue and allow progress on the database persistence layer.
