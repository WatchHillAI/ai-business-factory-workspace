## ðŸ’¼ **Business Intelligence Integration**

### **Data Flow Architecture:**
```typescript
// Typical idea development flow:
1. User Input â†’ Basic business idea concept
2. Market Intelligence â†’ Market analysis and validation
3. Financial Modeling â†’ Revenue projections and cost analysis
4. Founder Fit Analysis â†’ Team requirements and investment needs
5. Business Generator â†’ Comprehensive business plan
6. Strategy Manager â†’ Ongoing strategy optimization
```

### **Key Integration Points:**
```typescript
// Integration with market-intelligence domain:
interface IdeaAnalysisInput {
  idea: BasicIdea;
  marketAnalysis: MarketIntelligenceOutput;  // From market-intelligence domain
  userContext: UserContext;
}

// Output to user interfaces:
interface DetailedIdea {
  overview: ExecutiveSummary;
  marketAnalysis: MarketAnalysisOutput;
  financialModel: FinancialModelOutput;
  teamAndCosts: FounderFitOutput;
  strategy: StrategyOutput;
  riskAssessment: RiskAssessmentOutput;
}
```

### **User Experience Flow:**
```typescript
// Progressive disclosure in Ideas PWA:
1. Browse Ideas â†’ Card-based discovery interface
2. Select Idea â†’ Basic details and quick insights  
3. Deep Dive â†’ 6-tab comprehensive analysis:
   - Overview (executive summary, confidence scoring)
   - Market Analysis (signals, evidence, competitors)
   - Financial Model (TAM/SAM/SOM, projections, funding)
   - Team & Costs (founder fit, team composition, investment)
   - Strategy (go-to-market, competitive positioning)
   - Risk Assessment (risks, mitigations, scenarios)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Interface Guidelines**

### **Design Principles:**
- **Dark Mode First** - Premium feel with high contrast (18.3:1 ratio)
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Reveal complexity gradually
- **AI Integration** - Seamless AI-powered insights
- **Mobile Responsive** - PWA-first design
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.2 AA compliance

### **Component Architecture:**
```typescript
// Shared UI patterns:
interface IdeaCardProps {
  idea: BasicIdea;
  confidence?: number;
  onSelect: (id: string) => void;
  showDetails?: boolean;
}

interface DetailedViewProps {
  idea: DetailedIdea;
  activeTab: TabType;
  onTabChange: (tab: TabType) => void;
}
```

### **State Management:**
```typescript
// Zustand store pattern:
interface IdeaStore {
  ideas: DetailedIdea[];
  selectedIdea: DetailedIdea | null;
  analysisLoading: boolean;
  
  // Actions
  selectIdea: (id: string) => void;
  analyzeIdea: (idea: BasicIdea) => Promise<DetailedIdea>;
  updateIdea: (id: string, updates: Partial<DetailedIdea>) => void;
}
```

// Progressive enhancement pattern:
interface AnalysisState {
  basic: BasicAnalysis;       // Quick insights
  detailed?: DetailedAnalysis; // Full AI analysis
  confidence: number;         // Analysis quality
}

// AI integration pattern:
interface AIAnalysisHook {
  analyze: (idea: BasicIdea) => Promise<DetailedIdea>;
